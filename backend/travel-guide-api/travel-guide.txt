Implementation with No-Code Tools
Airtable:

Create separate bases for each main table

Link records between tables using relationship fields

Use views to create different perspectives (e.g., "Active Bookings")

Bubble.io:

Create data types that correspond to each table

Set up relationships between data types

Use the visual editor to create your UI

Glide:

Import your data from Google Sheets

Set up relationships between sheets

Create different pages for hotels, bookings, etc.

Simplified Version for Starters
If you're just starting, begin with these essential tables:

Users

Hotels

Rooms

Bookings

You can add more tables as your platform grows.

Would you like me to explain any part of this design in more detail or suggest specific no-code tools that would work well for implementing this?
